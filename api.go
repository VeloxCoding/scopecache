	// any single scope is bounded by the store budget, so a response
	// cap equal to the store cap guarantees every full-scope read
	// fits in one response — including drainer reads of `_events` which
	// must never be artificially capped (drainer lag → silent event
	// drop is the failure mode, not a 507 on tail).

// operator keeping two sets of knobs in sync.
//
// Takes *Gateway (the public type) rather than *store so adapters,
// addons and tests don't need to know the private store type. The
// HTTP layer reaches into gw.store for validation-cap reads and
// dispatches handlers through gw.store.* — validation runs at the
// store entry, not in the handlers.
