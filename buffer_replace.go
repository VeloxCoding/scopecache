// Bulk prepare-then-commit pipeline used by /warm and /rebuild.
//
// The shape is: build a complete replacement state OFF the buffer
// (validate every item, assign seqs, compute size), then commit it
// atomically under b.mu in a single state-swap. This separation is
// what lets multi-scope /warm be all-or-nothing — every scope is
// validated and built before any is committed; if any scope fails
// validation the existing state is untouched.
//
// Two commit variants exist:
//
//   - commitReplacement: stand-alone commit; computes its byte delta
//     against the buffer's current b.bytes under the lock. Used by
//     replaceAll (single-scope test path).
//
//   - commitReplacementPreReserved: batch-aware commit used by
//     Store.replaceScopes. The batch has already CAS-reserved its net
//     delta against totalBytes; this variant reconciles drift caused
//     by concurrent writes between snapshot and commit, but does NOT
//     re-add the delta itself.
//
// The drift-handling math in commitReplacementPreReserved is
// correctness-sensitive — concurrent writes between snapshot and
// commit must reconcile against the batch's pre-reserved delta.
// Re-run TestStore_ReplaceScopes_RaceVsWipe and
// TestStore_ReplaceScopes_RaceVsRebuild under stress after changes.
