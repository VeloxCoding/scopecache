// Locking invariants for *scopeBuffer
// -----------------------------------
//
//  1. Lock-acquisition order is strictly TOP-DOWN:
//     Store-level code may acquire scopeShard.mu BEFORE buf.mu.
//     Multi-shard ops additionally acquire shard.mu in ascending
//     shard-index order (see numShards comment in store.go).
//
//  2. scopeBuffer methods MUST NOT reach back up to acquire any
//     Store-level lock — neither scopeShard.mu nor any future
//     Store-side mutex — while holding b.mu. The only Store-state a
//     scopeBuffer method may touch with b.mu held is the atomic
//     counter (b.store.totalBytes.Add / b.store.reserveBytes); those
//     take no locks. Reverse-direction locking (buf → shard) would
//     deadlock against deleteScope, replaceScopes, wipe and
//     rebuildAll, all of which take shard.mu first and then
//     individual buf.mu's.
//
//  3. Read-path bookkeeping (recordRead) runs without taking b.mu —
//     it bumps the readCountTotal and lastAccessTS atomics directly.
//     This is what lets concurrent readers hold b.mu.RLock simultaneously
//     without serialising on the read counters. See recordRead in
//     buffer_heat.go.
//
// Adding a new scopeBuffer method that violates rule 2 is the most
// likely future deadlock — flag it in code review.
//
// File layout for scopeBuffer methods:
//
//	buffer.go          — struct + ctor + this invariant header
//	buffer_locked.go   — cross-cutting helpers (precomputeRenderBytes,
//	                     indexBySeqLocked, replaceItemAtIndexLocked,
//	                     reservePayloadDeltaLocked)
//	buffer_heat.go     — lock-free recordRead bookkeeping
//	buffer_write.go    — appendItem, upsertByID, updateByID, updateBySeq
//	buffer_counter.go  — counterAdd, parseCounterValue
//	buffer_delete.go   — deleteByID, deleteBySeq, deleteUpToSeq, deleteIndexLocked
//	buffer_replace.go  — scopeReplacement type, build / commit pipeline, replaceAll
//	buffer_read.go     — tailOffset, sinceSeq, getByID, getBySeq
//	buffer_stats.go    — approxSizeBytes, scopeStats type, stats()
