// cappedResponseWriter buffers a handler's full response so it can be
// inspected before any byte reaches the client. The wrapping middleware
// uses the buffer to enforce the per-response byte cap: if the handler
// writes more than the cap allows, the wrapper discards the buffer and
// replaces the response with a 507. Otherwise it replays the captured
// status, headers, and body verbatim.
//
// The wrapper is needed because Go HTTP cannot un-send headers — once
// WriteHeader(200) reaches the client, we cannot retroactively swap to
// 507. By intercepting WriteHeader and Write at the wrapper layer the
// handler's output stays in our control until we know whether to commit
// it or reject it.
//
// Memory note: the buffer can hold up to `cap` bytes per in-flight
// request. Above the cap we stop appending (the buffer is reset and
// subsequent writes are accepted-and-discarded), so memory is bounded
// even when a misbehaving handler tries to stream a multi-GB body.
