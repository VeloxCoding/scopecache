// Subscribe primitive — operator-facing contract is documented in
// docs/scopecache-core-rfc.md §7.4. In short: a Go-only, in-process
// mechanism by which a subscriber gets coalesced wake-up signals
// when items land in `_events` or `_inbox`. The subscriber drains
// the scope via Tail + DeleteUpTo in its own loop; this file owns
// the wake-up channel + lifecycle only.
//
// Implementation invariants:
//
//   - Restricted to reserved scopes (`_events`, `_inbox`); other
//     scopes return ErrInvalidSubscribeScope. User-managed scopes
//     are observable via `_events` auto-populate — that is why
//     `_events` exists.
//   - Single subscriber per reserved scope; a second Subscribe to
//     the same scope returns ErrAlreadySubscribed. Multi-fan-out is
//     the subscriber's job, not the cache's.
//   - Subscriber state at Store level keyed by scope name, not on
//     `*scopeBuffer`. Survives /wipe and /rebuild buffer churn
//     transparently — drainer doesn't reconnect across destructive
//     ops; cursor-rewind detection on the next Tail is enough.
//   - Single-slot, size-1 buffered channel with non-blocking send +
//     drop-on-full. Many writes while subscriber is busy coalesce
//     to one wake-up; subscriber re-Tails and processes the batch
//     via cursor.
//   - Close-on-unsub with lock-discipline: unsub() takes subsMu
//     .Lock, removes the map entry, then close(ch) — all under the
//     same Lock. Notify takes subsMu.RLock through the select-send
//     (brief, non-blocking). Send-on-closed-channel cannot happen
//     because the channel is only closed after the map entry is
//     gone.
//
// Lock-order:
//
//	Notify path:    [b.mu released] → subsMu.RLock → select-send → RUnlock
//	Subscribe path: subsMu.Lock → mutate map → Unlock
//	Unsubscribe:    subsMu.Lock → mutate map → close(ch) → Unlock
//
// b.mu and subsMu are independent — the notify hook in Store.appendOne
// fires AFTER buf.appendItem returns (b.mu already released). No path
// nests one inside the other.

// the channel pointer captured locally; it will either complete its
// send (slot empty) or hit the default branch (slot full) — either
// way it returns before unsub's Lock-acquire even completes. After
// step 2, no new notify can find the subscriber, so close(ch) in

// Caller invariants (not re-checked here):

//     This is the only call site, because every write that targets
//     `_events` or `_inbox` routes through appendOne (validator
//     rejects /upsert /update /counter_add on reserved scopes).
//
// RLock is held through the select-send so unsub cannot run
// concurrently (which would close the channel underneath the send
// and panic). The non-blocking select is brief enough that holding
// RLock through it costs nothing in practice.
