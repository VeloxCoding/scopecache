# End-to-end test suite: exercises every public scopecache endpoint over
# the real transport. Supports two modes, chosen by env:
#
#   unix socket (default) — standalone scopecache service:
#     SOCK=/run/scopecache.sock BASE=http://localhost
#     docker compose up -d --build scopecache
#     docker compose exec dev sh /src/scripts/e2e_test.sh
#
#   tcp — Caddy module wrapping the core (caddymodule/):
#     SOCK= BASE=http://caddyscope:8080
#     docker compose up -d --build caddyscope
#     docker compose exec -e SOCK= -e BASE=http://caddyscope:8080 dev \
#         sh /src/scripts/e2e_test.sh
#
# Empty SOCK disables --unix-socket and the script falls through to plain TCP.
# Every assertion is transport-agnostic — passing on both modes proves the
# standalone adapter and the Caddy adapter behave identically.
#
# The script does NOT fail fast. Every assertion runs, every failure is
# logged with its label and observed body, and the trailing summary
# reports `pass: N / fail: M`. The process exits 1 when at least one
# assertion failed, otherwise 0. This is deliberate: e2e regressions
# often cluster (a route change cascades into multiple shape checks),
# and a single run that surfaces the whole set is more useful than
# fixing one error, rerunning, and finding the next.
#
# Scope: the **current core** only — every endpoint in handlers.go's
# RegisterRoutes (append, upsert, update, counter_add, delete,
# delete_up_to, head, tail, get, render, wipe, warm, rebuild,
# delete_scope, stats, help). Endpoints that used to live in core but
# moved out (/admin, /guarded, /delete_guarded, /inbox, /multi_call,
# /delete_scope_candidates, /ts_range) are not exercised here — when
# they return as addons each will get its own per-addon e2e_test.sh.
#
# Optional events_mode=full coverage: set EXPECT_EVENTS=full AND start
# the cache with events_mode=full to run the auto-populate block
# below. Known side-effect: under events_mode=full the cache emits
# one `_events` entry per successful mutation, which means several
# pre-existing assertions that hard-coded events_mode=off semantics
# will fail (in particular: /stats `total_items`, /stats `scope_count`
# after /wipe, /scopelist totals, ts-stats freshness asserts that
# expect `last_write_ts` to be tied 1:1 to the latest user-write).
# These are TODO-wired-as-events-aware in a future pass; for now the
# events_mode=full run is interpreted as "the events block must pass
# clean; pre-existing failures are catalogued and acceptable until
# the events-aware rewrite lands".

# strictly between 0 and the configured cap, and last_write_ts strictly
# greater than the value /wipe stamped (proving every subsequent write
# advanced the freshness tick). A regression on any write/delete path

# --- /stats freshness contract: every mutation advances last_write_ts ---------
# Per-operation tightening of the aggregate-counters block above. The

# contents at one snapshot; this block walks every state-changing
# endpoint individually and asserts that:
#
#   1. total_items moves by exactly the right delta on every op
#      (append +1, upsert-create +1, upsert-replace 0, update 0,
#      delete -1, delete_up_to -N, delete_scope -|scope|, wipe -all)
#   2. scope_count moves by exactly the right delta
#   3. last_write_ts strictly advances on every state-changing op —
#      this is the polling contract: any client that re-queries only
#      when last_write_ts has changed is guaranteed to see the new
#      state
#   4. last_write_ts on /stats equals item.ts for the most recent
#      successful single-item write (the store-wide max equals the
#      per-item stamp because the cache uses one nowUs() for both,
#      see buffer_write.go's insertNewItemLocked)
#
# Everything is timestamped via sleep 1 between ops so the
# strict-greater check is reliable even on hosts where two writes
# could otherwise land in the same microsecond.
